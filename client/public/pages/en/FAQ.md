## About Mirlo

### What is Mirlo?

Mirlo provides a user-friendly space to help musicians sell music, manage subscriptions, and share with their supporters.

### What are the long term goals of Mirlo?

We believe that the community is the platform and our goals, informed by our [Observations and Intent](https://funmusic.place/observations-and-intent/), will grow and change along with the community.

That said, we would like to make it easier for other groups (like music labels or other co-ops) to install the software. We’d also like to look into building plug-ins and other tools that are useful for artists (for example, plug-ins that help to make your music available on aggregators like Distrokids or other platforms).

Eventually, we hope to [exit to our community](https://blog.fracturedatlas.org/exit-to-community).

### How do I add support tiers?

You can add support tiers by going to your artist's profile, clicking “edit page” (or navigating to it through the top right dropdown menu), and then switching to the “Support tiers” tab. There's an “+ add tier” button that will let you create a support tier.

### How can I sell individual tracks?

We currently don’t support selling of individual tracks, but if you want to see this feature implemented, [upvote it on our ideas tracker](https://github.com/funmusicplace/mirlo/discussions/509).

### Image support

For our album, avatar, and background images we encourage people to upload higher resolution images. If you have issues with your specific image, please contact us at [mirlodotspace@proton.me](mailto:mirlodotspace@proton.me)

### Can an artist make a listener account, will that be a problem in the future?

There’s only one account type on Mirlo! Any user can make an artist to upload music to at any point. To do so, click on the top right menu and click on “Manage Artist”, this will let you add new artists.
