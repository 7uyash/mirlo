            Our members have experience working both within Resonate and Ampled,
            other co-ops across several industries, mutual aid and community
            organizing efforts, and complex high-traffic web platforms. We
            envision this platform as a tool to support musicians in cultivating
            direct and reciprocal relationships and resources to sustain one
            another’s creative practice.

            While Mirlo is legally incorporated as an LLC recognized by the
            United States of America, our work is hugely dependent on a network
            of people who have helped us get to where we are. We're immensely
            grateful to everyone who is supporting us through labor or financial
            contributions to get us here.

            Mirlo is structured as a worker owned co-operative. Our three

                  Mirlo allows for direct and ongoing support of artists. It’s
                  different from other crowdfunding platforms because it:

                    <li>
                      is rooted in mutual aid and an explicitly anti-capitalist

                    <li>
                      is stewared by a worker co-op, which intends to

                    We’d also like to look into building plug-ins and other
                    tools that are useful for artists (for example, plug-ins

          <p>
            Mirlo is an ambitious project, and to pull it off we will need money
            to pay ourselves for our time as well as for all the material costs
            of running a business at this scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            As outlined above, Mirlo takes a small percentage from each
            transaction on the platform. However, for that to make us
            sustainable, we will need over 100s of thousands of dollars moving
            through the platform on any given month (see our{" "}
            <a href="/team/posts/16/">take rate discussion</a>). So we need to
            get creative. But before we dive into how we do that, consider

            more. We will link to our budget for the second half of 2024 once
